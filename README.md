# PitayaSwap Finance

Pitaya Finance (“Pitaya”) is a non-custodial, cross-chain compatible, delta-one asset protocol. Pitaya’s long term DeFi vision is to increase inclusiveness and democratize access to investment assets (digital and  traditional). Tremendous value exists in the ability for investors to easily and quickly invest, save fees, and secure assets at fair market value. Pitaya combines substantial technical experience from numerous crypto projects with extensive financial experience in exotic and structured assets from traditional global asset management firms to bring to market one of the first DeFi projects built upon Binance Smart Chain with cross-chain compatibility. Pitaya will allow users to build and manage spot or portfolio exposures with a slew of innovative digital and traditional financial products. Pitaya is backed by our Binance Smart Chain-based Pitaya Token (PTA) with synthetic assets built on other EVM compatible chains first and other prominent blockchains in the long run, making the staking, investing, and redemption process easier, quicker and with substantially lower transaction fees whilst maintaining access to the Binance Smart Chain DeFi ecosystem.
